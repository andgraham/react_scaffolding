# React scaffolding

An opinionated scaffolding with the following technical stack and configuration:

* React  (0.13.x)
* React Router (1.x)
* Flux by using Redux (1.x)
* Webpack
* CSS Modules
* Stylus
* Seamless Immutable
* Hot module replacement
* Babel

The idea is to provide a base structure that enable consumers to start building freatures and deliver a production ready package of a Single Page App.


### Bundle process

The scaffolding provides a feature-rich configuration for delivering the application as well as a rich development experience.
