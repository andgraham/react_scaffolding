# React scaffolding

An opinionated scaffolding with the following technical stack and configuration:

* React  (0.13.x)
* React Router (1.x)
* Flux by using Redux (1.x)
* Webpack
* CSS Modules
* Stylus
* Seamless Immutable
* Hot module replacement
* Babel

The idea is to provide a base structure that enable consumers to start building freatures and deliver a production ready package of a Single Page App.

## Getting started

To start hacking simply do:

```
$ npm install
$ make run
```
Point browser to http://localhost:9898

## Rational behing the stack

Check the resources [section](https://github.com/rafaelchiti/react_scaffolding/wiki/resources) for talks and explanations on WHY the stack I present here.

### Bundle process

The scaffolding provides a feature-rich configuration for delivering the application as well as a rich development experience.
